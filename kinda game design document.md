## Summary/Overview

The game is supposed to be kind of combination between [[civ]] and [[crusader kings]], pretty much like [[old world]]. There is a 4x (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) focus, but it is also complemented by a 4d focus (Decline, Destruction, Dissolution, Division). Where the first part of the game is focused on exploring and expansion, while the second part of the game is more focused on decline and division. 
The main purpose for this is to have a more refreshing less cluttered end-game where the victor is decided many turns before. However, a risk is that the victor is decided even earlier.

In order to have an interesting 4d experience there will be leaders and factions like in [[crusader kings]], [[old world]] and [[stellaris]]. These both limit and expand the number of actions you have. Upsetting a faction or leader can make them rebel or defect. However in some cases this can be good since a city or faction can use a lot of resources while giving very little in return. This opens another dimension of strategy of using a city and faction while they are worth it but leaving them when needed.

Another big focus is that the world is (mostly in the second part of the game) in its destuction. The world will fall apart while the player plays, leaving less and less of the world to work with. The more of the world that has been consumed by the void the bigger the influence of the old gods. Instead of science progress to new tech and similiar stuff is gained through doing rituals to the old gods. This grants you a part of their power, while dragging your civilization closer to their being. The science tree will probably be quite like the one in [[Solium Infernum]].

## Goals

### Victory conditions

#### Conquest

By occupying every other factions capital at the same time ( at any point in the game) will instantly finish the game with the remaining player being the victor

#### Awakening

By finishing the "science" tree and descending your god unto the mortal plane through a ritual, the summonee instantly wins the game.

#### Fulfillment

After having reached sufficient enough connection with your god, you can at any point decide to forego all other win conditions (not sure if all yet or only points) and instead opt to try complete some tasks/quests/specifics given from your god

#### Score

If no one has won when the whole game has passed, and the whole world has disappeared then the person with the highest score wins

#### Alliance

If a player is allied with all other remaning players they win (maybe not instantly).

#### Survival

If no other player is still standing, the remaining player wins.


#### Maybe? 

- Hold some objectives for a certain amount of time? 

## Turn

A turn is very similiar to normal 4x games, however one does not have unlimited actions like in for example [[civ]], but is closer to [[solium infernum]] or [[old world]] in the sense that the player only has a set amount of actions each turn.
This forces the player to makes choices of how to spend their turns, since doing everything is not an option.

## Actions

## Turn order bidding

In turn-based games the turn order is generally really important since that can determine who fights first in a battle, has priority when taking tiles or creating wonders. For this reason the players can bid "faith" to determine the turn order. Whoever bids the most will go first, the second most second and so on. In a tie the player who was last the last turn will go first. 

If no bids were made then the turn order circually goes around. 

## Tiles

Each tile can have one improvement, one building and one unit on it a a time. 
Controlling a tile will give you a resource corresponding to the type of the tile. 
Improving a tile will give you extra of that resource and any material that is on that tile. 

Yield from tiles will diminish throughout the game, making having improvements very important.
(Question is if all tiles have the same decline or if just controlled tiles have this decline (would be harder but more realistic ig))

Furthermore, tiles can have cities and buildings on them. 

### Cities

Cities have happines and population as well as upgrades.

### Base resources

- Food
   - Used to feed and create new population
   - If you have no feed, the population will get angry and pregress will stagnate.
- Wood (Should be able to be saved in some way, since the name of the game is saving stuff)
   - Used mainly for creating buildings
   - Also used by population (to keep them baseline happy)
   - If you have no wood then creating new buildings will be hard and people will be mad.
- Minerals
   - Mainly used for creating units (together with other stuff sometimes)
   - If you have no minerals both attacking and defending will be hard 
- Faith/Offerings
   - Used as both money and science.
   - By using faith one can get other resources from a god (if no other player wants to trade for it).
   - Can hasten building of things
   - Provide buffs to units
   - Create a deeper bond (progress connection/science level) to a god

#### Gain

Food, Wood and Minerals can directly be gained from controlling the right kind of tile and a greater quality of them from improving the correct tile. 
Resources and their corresponding tiles are:

- Woods: Wood
- Plains: Food
- Hills: Wood/Food/Minerals (however in lesser amounts)
- Mountains: Mineral
- Sea: Food/Minerals
- Desert: None (if not under the correct circumstances)

Faith/offerings are directly gained from population. The higher population the greater faith will be gained. 
It is also possible to create buildings that will generate more and make each pop create more.

Another way to get the base resources is to pillage other players. By occupying other players cities and or buildings the pillager will gain a large amount of resources from the pillaged player. 
This is different from a war in the sense that the pillaged player will not actually lose the buildings, city or population. 

#### Loss

To progress your civilization requires resources. Without them you become stagnant and will be conquered by the opposing players. 

It also costs resources to keep your civilization going, therefore it is important to know when to cut of limbs that are no longer useful. 

### Materials

### Improvements

Improvements are easy to construct. A city can improve nearby tiles. This should be simple to do, simply choose what kind of tile you want to improve and it will be done automatically (maybe with possibility of more fine grained control). 

Improving a tile should not inherently cost and resources, however should not be free. One should not be able to expand their economy at the same time as doing other stuff. This cost could come in the form of costing actions or/and taking multiple turns to finish. 

### Cities

Cities are a players stronghold, with them being at the center of a lot of mechanics. 

It is from them players create units, buildings, do rituals, store resources and much more.

However, they also contain factions having different goals for your civilization which can make cities rebel or possibly desert. 

Cities can be created in the first phase of the game, but not in the second. 

### Buildings

## Entities

An entity can:
- Move
- Attack
- Take damage
- Special action
- Get buffed
- Get debuffed

### Units

### Cities

## Leaders

### Satisfaction

### Rebellions

## Religion/Science
