# This is a document that documents how the time of each frame is spent

Ideally this program/game should run on 60 fps on all systems and screen sizes.

Right now for a computer with a screen of 1920 x 1080 and specs:

AMD RYZEN 4500U with Radeon Grapcihs

8 gb RAM

AMD Radeon(TM) graphics

the time is spent:

**GOAL** = <16 ms

- Rendering => 0 - 1 ms 
- Updating user input => ~= 3-4 ms

- **Total** = <4-5 ms
