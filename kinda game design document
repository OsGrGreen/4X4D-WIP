## Summary/Overview

The game is supposed to be kind of combination between [[civ]] and [[crusader kings]], pretty much like [[old world]]. There is a 4x (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) focus, but it is also complemented by a 4d focus (Decline, Destruction, Dissolution, Division). Where the first part of the game is focused on exploring and expansion, while the second part of the game is more focused on decline and division. 
The main purpose for this is to have a more refreshing less cluttered end-game where the victor is decided many turns before. However, a risk is that the victor is decided even earlier.

In order to have an interesting 4d experience there will be leaders and factions like in [[crusader kings]], [[old world]] and [[stellaris]]. These both limit and expand the number of actions you have. Upsetting a faction or leader can make them rebel or defect. However in some cases this can be good since a city or faction can use a lot of resources while giving very little in return. This opens another dimension of strategy of using a city and faction while they are worth it but leaving them when needed.

Another big focus is that the world is (mostly in the second part of the game) in its destuction. The world will fall apart while the player plays, leaving less and less of the world to work with. The more of the world that has been consumed by the void the bigger the influence of the old gods. Instead of science progress to new tech and similiar stuff is gained through doing rituals to the old gods. This grants you a part of their power, while dragging your civilization closer to their being. The science tree will probably be quite like the one in [[Solium Infernum]].
