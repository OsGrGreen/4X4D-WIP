# Factions

Factions should preferrably be very unique while playing of the same ground concepts. A good idea to make factions different is that each faction has a special interaction/relationship with a fundemental game mechanic. This could be that they cant form contrats with the Old gods or locked into a singular one. Can not settle cities but have to constantly move around and so on.
